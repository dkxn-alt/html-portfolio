 <h1>TV show tierlist</h1>
 <h2>The goats, top 3</h2>
 <hr />
<br/>

<h3>How I met your mother</h3>
<p>Absolute goat of a show, nothing comes close</p>
<br/>

<h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
<p>A close second to 1st place, mainly due to nostalgia.</p>
<br/>

<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>I absolutely love sitcoms and this one is one of the goates<br/>
    due to all the quirky humour.
